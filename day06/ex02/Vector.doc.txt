<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles space 3D Vectors.
An instance is contructed from two Vertex orig and dest.
It represents then the vector between thos two points.
new Vector( array( 'dest' => #instanceOfVertex, 'orig' => #instanceOfVertex );
Ff the vertex 'orig' is not precised, it will then be (0,0,0) as default.

All Attributes are private, you may want to use getters.
When a Vector is created, you wont be able to change its values after.
aka-> no setters;

The class provides the following methods :
float magnitude() : returns the vector's length.
vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector.
vector add(vector $rhs) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.
vector sub(vector $rhs) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.
vector opposite : returs the opposite vector.
vector scalarProduct($k) : returns the multiplication of the vector 
with a scalar.
float dotProduct(Vector $rhs) : returns the scalar multiplication
of both vectors.
float cos(vector $rhs) : returns the angle's Appendix cosine between
both vectors.
vector crossProduct(vector $rhs) : returns the cross multiplication of
both vectors.
